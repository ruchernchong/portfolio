/**
 * Steps for {@link import("./sync-model-registry").syncModelRegistryWorkflow}.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate module from the workflow function. A `"use workflow"`
 * function is compiled into a sandboxed VM with no Node.js access, and the
 * sandbox check applies to everything its module imports — `next/cache` reaches
 * it transitively through `@/lib/queries/usage`. Steps have full Node access, so
 * keeping them here leaves the workflow module a pure orchestrator.
 *
 * Every return value is serialised into the run journal, so these stay small:
 * the merged registry is ~6,000 entries and is handed between steps through the
 * Redis cache rather than through the journal. Journal I/O is encrypted, so
 * source health and repricing outcomes are also written to the run's default
 * stream (`npx workflow inspect streams --runId <id>` / the Vercel run page).

 * that stays down narrows the merge instead of failing the run — the property

 * (then decrypt) is the log, not the run return value. A degraded source still
 * lets lower-precedence sources win the merge for models they both carry, and
 * the upsert is unconditional — see the follow-up on not downgrading a row when
