/**
 * Ingest daily token-usage aggregates into *this* deployment's database.
 *
 * The `usage:ingest` script parses local agent logs (which only exist on the
 * machine that ran the agents), prices and folds them into daily rows, then
 * POSTs them here. Because the write happens server-side, production data is
 * ingested using the deployment's own `DATABASE_URL` — the prod connection
 * string never has to touch the local machine.
 *
 * Writes are gated to the static MCP token or an admin session (OAuth sign-up is
 * open, so a plain authenticated session is not enough to overwrite prod data).
 *
 * The upsert is the only synchronous work. Refreshing the model registry and
 * repricing previously-unpriceable rows are handed to
 * {@link syncModelRegistryWorkflow}, which runs off the request path with
 * per-source retries and a visible success/failure record — this route used to
 * do all of it inline behind a `logWarning`, which is how a missing table went
 * unnoticed for a week.
