/**
 * Ingest daily token-usage aggregates into *this* deployment's database.
 *
 * The `usage:ingest` script parses local agent logs (which only exist on the
 * machine that ran the agents), prices and folds them into daily rows, then
 * POSTs them here. Because the write happens server-side, production data is
 * ingested using the deployment's own `DATABASE_URL` — the prod connection
 * string never has to touch the local machine.
 *
 * Writes are gated to the static MCP token or an admin session (OAuth sign-up is
 * open, so a plain authenticated session is not enough to overwrite prod data).
 * After the upsert, every still-`NULL`-cost row is repriced from its stored
 * tokens (healing stale orphans whose source log was pruned, so re-ingesting can
 * no longer reach them), then the `usage` and `models:providers` cache tags are
 * revalidated so the public `/usage` page reflects both the new data and any
 * display names the registry sync just learned.
