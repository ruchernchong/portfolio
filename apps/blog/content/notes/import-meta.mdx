I recently found out about the `import.meta` syntax while working on [Sanity](https://sanity.io) that uses Vite.

The `import.meta` is an object that is bundled with the JavaScript Modules. It contains information about the module and is extensible.

The following is an example of using the query parameters with the `import` syntax.

```html
<script type="module">
  import "./index.mjs?someParams=foo";
</script>
```

The `index.mjs` module is able to read the parameters `someParams` using the `import.meta` syntax

```js
new URL(import.meta.url).searchParams.get("someParams"); // foo
```

This is something new to me in which it cannot be done when using `process.env`

## TypeScript

We are able to create the typing through `env.d.ts` in the root of the project

```ts
// env.d.ts
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  SOME_ENV_VARIABLE: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

## Uses

This is normally used in the browser.
