title: New Array Prototype Methods

While reading [The State of JS 2022](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/features/language/), I came across two new `Array.prototype` methods which I previously have not heard of. They are `Array.prototype.at()` and `Array.prototype.findLast()`.

## .at()

This is going to be very useful for returning a value at a particular index in the array without having to iterate through. This great improve the time complexity to O(1) which is the best.

An example from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at):

```js
const array = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

array.at(2); // 8
```

The `.at()` makes the code looks sweet, short and simple.

## .findLast()

As we know, the `.find()` method is one of the most commonly used method to-date. The `.findLast()` is the opposite where it iterates the array in a reverse order. This is so useful if I want to search for a value that appear the last.

An example from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findLast):

```js
const array = [5, 12, 50, 130, 44];

array.findLast((item) => item > 45); // 130
```
