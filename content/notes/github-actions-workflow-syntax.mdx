It appears that GitHub Actions workflow can be quite particular with single-quotes (`'`) and double-quotes (`"`)

For example:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
```

> [!NOTE]
> While this should not technically matter, GitHub Actions can sometimes be particular about pattern matching.
