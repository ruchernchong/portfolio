We are all familiar with things like:

1. `console.log()`
2. `console.error()`
3. `console.warn()`
4. `console.info()`

But, `console.table()` is a really interesting one.

It basically displays the data that one would log to the console in a table form, as per what the method suggests so.

## Example

```js
const items = ["foo", "bar", "baz"];

console.table(items);
```

| Index | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0     | foo   |
| 1     | bar   |
| 2     | baz   |

`console.table()` definitely formats the data nicely and makes things easier to read.
