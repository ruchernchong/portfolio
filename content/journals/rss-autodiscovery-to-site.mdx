Interestingly, there is a way to actually add the RSS feed to a site for RSS readers to pull up through their autodiscovery feature.

```html
<link
  rel="alternate"
  type="application/rss+xml"
  title="RSS feed for site"
  href="/rss"
/>
```

And if the feed is an ATOM feed, change the `type` to `application/atom+xml`
