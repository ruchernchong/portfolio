title: Parse String to Boolean using JSON.parse()

`JSON.parse()` is able to convert a string to boolean easily while retaining its value.

```js
let strTrue = "true";
let strFalse = "false";

console.log(JSON.parse(strTrue)); // true
console.log(JSON.parse(strFalse)); // false
```

While working on environment variables using `process.env` from a `.env` file, I realised that I had to use strict equal `process.env.SOME_VARIABLE === "true"` in order to make the condition as a valid boolean since environment variables are `typeof` String. While finding a better way around this, I came across using the `JSON.parse()` way that seems to make it easier. I was able to write a reusable function to make things easier for me too.

```yaml .env
SOME_VARIABLE=true
```

```ts
const isFeatureEnabled = (feature: string): boolean => {
  return JSON.parse(feature);
};

isFeatureEnabled(process.env.SOME_VARIABLE); // true
```

Let me know how other ways do you handle converting a string of values "true" or "false" to their boolean values.
