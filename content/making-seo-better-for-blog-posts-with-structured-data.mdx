excerpt: How to use Structured Data to assist us with describing the content of a particular page
---

Search engines like Google use structured data to understand the contents of our page better. [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) is a format that most use to describe the data.

## Structured Data

Below is an example of a piece of structured data.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://json-ld.org/contexts/person.jsonld",
  "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Lennon",
  "name": "John Lennon",
  "born": "1940-10-09",
  "spouse": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cynthia_Lennon"
}
```

Source: [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org)

## Adding Structured Data in Next.js

1. Create the following component `StructuredData.jsx`. Here we use the built-in component from `next/head` to append elements to the `head` of the page.

```jsx StructuredData.jsx
import Head from "next/head";

export const StructuredData = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <Head>
      <script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify(data)}</script>
    </Head>
  );
};
```

2. Use the `StructuredData` component in your respective component containing the UI for your post.

```jsx BlogPost.jsx
export const BlogPost = ({ post }) => {
  const structuredData = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    headline: post.title,
    description: post.description,
    author: [
      {
        "@type": "Person",
        name: post.author,
      },
    ],
    image: post.imageUrl,
    datePublished: post.publishedAt,
  };
};

return (
  <>
    <Structured data={structuredData} />
    {/* ... the rest of your blog post */}
  </>
);
```

## Validate Structured Data

Before deploying the changes to production, we can inspect the HTML elements on a browser to see if the changes are reflected in the `<head>` section of the page.

Upon successful deployment, we can use the [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) to validate.
