So what is the `!` in TypeScript?

This is actually known as a non-null assertion operator.

Take for example the following code:

```typescript
type Item = {
  title: string;
  value: string;
};

const items: Item[] = [
  { title: "Foo", value: "Foo" },
  { title: "Bar", value: "Bar" },
  { title: "Alpha", value: "Alpha" },
];

const getAlpha = items.find((item) => item.title === "Alpha");
```

The following will return a type `Item | undefined`. In some scenarios, we are not allowed to parse an `undefined` value and therefore we need to write extra code just to handle the `undefined` value first.

One of the most common way is to do the following.

```js
if (getAlpha) {
  return <SomeComponent alpha={getAlpha} />;
}
```

Or we could type cast it back to the Item type like the following.

```js
<SomeComponent alpha={getAlpha as Item} />
```

However, with the `!` in TypeScript. We are able to just do the following and return the type `Item` quickly.

```typescript
const getAlpha = items.find((item) => item.title === "Alpha")!;
```

The use of `!` however does not remove the fact that the `Array.find()` will not return a `null` or `undefined` at all.

## Swift

> Swift is used as the programming language for creating apps on iOS, macOS, watchOS.

Since I have created an Augmented Reality(AR) App in Swift before, the `!` works very similarly and is very commonly used.

The `!` in Swift is used to force unwrapping of optionals.

Example:

```swift
let title: String? = "Foo"

if title != nil {
    var something = title!
}
```

So as you have guessed it, the `!` actually forces the optional value in the variable `name` and gain access to the `String` value.

## Summary

And that is all for this post. Just wanted to share something regarding the `!` operator that I discovered while writing code in Swift and now being able to also use it in TypeScript.
