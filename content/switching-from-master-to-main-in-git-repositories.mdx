title: Switching from 'master' to 'main' in Git Repositories

excerpt: A guide on adapting to GitHub's 'main' as the default branch for new repositories, including steps for global configuration changes.

All GitHub repositories starts to switch from `master` to `main` from 1 October 2020. Despite the change, it is not enforced that the `master` branch will face with any significant problems if anyone continues to use. However, new repository created will use the `main` branch as the default.

Since most new projects will now start with the `main` branch as the default, we would like to reduce the need to re-configure between `master` and `main`.

## How to change to use `main` as the default branch

Luckily, git allows us to do this quickly and easily from the global configuration.

There are two ways we can do so.

1. We can edit the `~/.gitconfig` file directly with the following changes.

```shell ~/.gitconfig
[init]
	defaultBranch = main
```

2. Using the CLI command to set the configuration

```shell
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

With the new configuration, we will now be able to create git repositories with the branch being created as `main` right from the onset.

Of course, certain organisations may use very different naming for their default branch and we can use the same way to make the changes accordingly.
