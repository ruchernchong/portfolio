title: Managing Environment Variables in Node (process.env) and Browsers (import.meta)

excerpt: Explore handling sensitive data with process.env in Node and the versatile import.meta in JavaScript Modules, including TypeScript support.

## process.env

The `process.env` is a global variable that is only used by Node at runtime and this can only be used in node and not in the browser. This is the most familiar way to handle environment variables that we do not want to commit into git that could expose some serious sensitive information.

Following is an example of how we use `process.env` and usually being used during build time.

```js config.js
const DATABASE_URL = process.env.DATABASE_URL;
```

## import.meta

`import.meta` is an object that is bundled with the JavaScript Modules. It contains information about the module and is extensible.

The following is an example from [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta#passing_query_parameters) that uses the query parameters with the `import` syntax.

```html
<script type="module">
  import "./index.mjs?someParams=foo";
</script>
```

The `index.mjs` module is able to read the parameters `someParams` using the `import.meta` syntax

```js
new URL(import.meta.url).searchParams.get("someParams"); // foo
```

This is something new to me in which it cannot be done when using `process.env`

## TypeScript support for `import.meta`

For those who prefer to use TypeScript, we can create the relevant types through a global file - `env.d.ts` in the root of the project.

```typescript env.d.ts
// env.d.ts
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  SOME_ENV_VARIABLE: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```
