## Development

### Prerequisites
- PNPM 10.22.0 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for compatibility)
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- Redis instance (Upstash recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and configure
4. Run database migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
5. (Optional) Seed database: `pnpm db:seed`
6. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`

### Available Commands
See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for complete command reference including:
- Development, testing, and build commands
- Database management (migrations, studio, seeding)
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Custom slash commands for coding agents

### Usage collector (macOS)

The `agent-usage` CLI, a Rust binary, parses local Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, and Grok logs and POSTs daily
token and session effort rows together to `https://ruchern.dev/api/usage/ingest`.
Claude and Codex effort settings are read from the same logs as their tokens;
sessions without recorded effort remain unclassified. Auth is OAuth (admin account),
not `BLOG_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`. 15-minute LaunchAgent optional.

Install the prebuilt universal binary from the latest release
(no checkout or Rust toolchain needed), or build from a checkout with
`bash apps/cli/macos/install.sh` (needs Rust). Details:
[apps/cli/macos/INSTALL.md](./apps/cli/macos/INSTALL.md)

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/ruchernchong/blog/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
~/.local/bin/agent-usage auth login   # admin account
~/.local/bin/agent-usage run         # POST if there are rows; then check /usage
```

`agent-usage update` installs the latest release in place. `agent-usage --help`
lists the commands (`measure`, `ingest`, `auth`, `update`, `completions`).

## Contributing

### Commit Conventions
This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test updates
- `chore:` - Tooling and configuration

Commits are validated via Commitlint with a 72 character header limit.

### Code Quality
- Pre-commit hooks run linting and formatting via Husky
- All commits must pass Biome checks
- `pnpm knip` must stay clean (unused files, exports, and dependencies)
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced
- Tests should maintain coverage levels

### Release Process
Automated via semantic-release on push to `main` branch:
1. CI runs tests, linting, and builds
2. Semantic version is determined from commit messages
3. Changelog is auto-generated
4. GitHub release is created with git tag
