- Node.js 18+ (for compatibility)
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- Redis instance (Upstash recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and configure
4. Run database migrations: `pnpm db:migrate`
5. (Optional) Seed database: `pnpm db:seed`
6. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`

### Available Commands
See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for complete command reference including:
- Development, testing, and build commands
- Database management (migrations, studio, seeding)
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Custom slash commands for Claude Code

## Contributing

### Commit Conventions
This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test updates
- `chore:` - Tooling and configuration

Commits are validated via Commitlint with a 72 character header limit.

### Code Quality
- Pre-commit hooks run linting and formatting via Husky
- All commits must pass Biome checks
- `pnpm knip` must stay clean (unused files, exports, and dependencies)
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced
- Tests should maintain coverage levels

### Release Process
Automated via semantic-release on push to `main` branch:
1. CI runs tests, linting, and builds
2. Semantic version is determined from commit messages
3. Changelog is auto-generated
4. GitHub release is created with git tag
